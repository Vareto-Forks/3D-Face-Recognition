# 3D Face Datasets

This repository contains a list of 3D face datasets. Each has a short description, year published and download url. Note that, the first 10 datasets (e.g. ) are most often used as training set for deep learning-based 3D face recognition approaches. To the best of my knowledge, the LS3DFace [1] is the largest 3D face dataset to date, which contains 1,853 identities with 31,860 scans. This is in fact a merged dataset from the most challenging public datasets (FRGCv2, BU3DFE, Bosphorus, GavabDB, Texes FRD, BU4DFE, CASIA, UMB DB, 3D-TEC, and ND-2006). 

## FRGC v2 Dataset

**Description**: The FRGC v2 is a large-scale 3D face recognition benchmark dataset with 446 identities and 4007 scans. The data consists of 3D scans and high resolution still imagery taken under controlled and uncontrolled conditions.

3D-TEC [3]  

**Original paper**: 

**Description**: 

**Year of release**:

The 3D-TEC database contains 107 pairs (total 214 subjects) of twins and expressions of neutral and
smiling scan are captured for each subject. Since twins are
visually similar to each other, it is harder to identify a probe
where the corresponding twin of the probe is in a gallery set.
Identifying twins visually are sometimes hard even for humans.

Bosphorus [4] 

**Original paper**: 

**Description**: 

**Year of release**:

The Bosphorus database contains 4,666 3D
facial scans over 105 subjects with rich expression variations, poses, occlusions. The 2,902 scans contain expression variations from 105 subjects. In the experiment, 105
first neutral scans from each identity are used as a gallery
set and 2797 non-neutral scans are used as a probe set

BU-3DFE [5] 

**Original paper**: 

**Description**: 

**Year of release**:

which includes 100 subjects with 2500 facial expression models.  Each subject made 6 expressions (e.g. happiness, disgust, fear and so on) with
four levels of intensity from low to high and a neutral expression. The resolution of this database is low compared
to other databases

3D Mask Attack Dataset [13] 

**Original paper**: 

**Description**: 

**Year of release**:

It currently contains 76500 frames of 17 persons, recorded using Kinect for both real-access and spoofing attacks. Each frame consists of a depth image (640x480 pixels – 1x11 bits), the corresponding RGB image (640x480 pixels – 3x8 bits), manually annotated eye positions (with respect to the RGB image).

EURECOM Kinect 3D Face Dataset [14]

**Original paper**: 

**Description**: 

**Year of release**:

A database of images of different facial expressions in different lighting and occlusion conditions to serve various research purposes. The Dataset consists of the multimodal facial images of 52 people (14 females, 38 males) obtained by Kinect

FaceWarehouse: a 3D Facial Expression Database for Visual Computing [15]

**Original paper**: 

**Description**: 

**Year of release**:


A RGBD Facial Expression Database for Visual Computing , we captured 150 individuals aged 7-80 from various ethnic backgrounds. For each person, we captured the RGBD data of her different expressions, including the neutral expression and 19 other expressions such as mouth-opening, smile, kiss, etc. For every RGBD raw data record, a set of facial feature points on the color image such as eye corners, mouth contour and the nose tip are automatically localized, and manually adjusted if better accuracy is required. We then deform a template facial mesh to fit the depth data as closely as possible while matching the feature points on the color image to their corresponding points on the mesh. From these fitted face meshes, we construct a set of individual-specific expression blendshapes for each person.
